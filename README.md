# XENO TOOL
powerful python tool for windows

# Linux/Mac support
This will likely never happen due to most functions being either Windows only or not very functional on Linux/Mac.
Who knows though?

# OPTIONS 

## IP Lookup
### uses ipapi.com to track IPs down

## Server Nuker
### uses older modified leaked version of msc that runs suprisingly well

## Webhook Diddler
### spams everyone and here pings through a webhook

# PULL REQUESTS/ISSUES

Feel free to experiment with Xeno if you want. If you find any bugs, make an issue for it!
